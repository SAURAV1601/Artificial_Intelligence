## Handwritten Digit Recognition

* Given dataset 'digitsData' contains handwritten digits in 32*32 boolean format.
* Built a manchine learning model to recognize these hand written digits using Neural networks.
* 1024 features are select from the 32*32 boolean format and model is trained using 10 to 100 hidden layers and hidden nodes from 100 to 1000.
* The precision of the model increases with increase in hidden layers and hidden nodes.

### Dependencies
* scikit-learn
